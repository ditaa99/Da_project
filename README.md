### Objective
- Analyze and visualize patterns in traffic accidents in Zurich since 2011

### Dependencies
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- Seaborn

## Steps

### Data Processing
1. Check uniqueness and change data types for faster processing.
2. Check for null values in the dataset.

### Visualizations
We have generated a comprehensive set of visualizations to delve into various aspects of traffic accidents in Zurich. Starting with the **Accident Types Bar Plot**, we explore the frequency and distribution of different accident types, each highlighted with labeled bars. Moving on to the **Accidents by Day of the Week**, we analyze the frequency of incidents occurring on each day. The **Peak Hour of Accidents** visualization identifies the specific hours during which accidents peak for each day of the week. The **Accidents Over Time** plot reveals trends in the overall number of accidents throughout the years, emphasizing the peak year with a distinctive red star marker. The **Accident Types Over Time** plot analyzes how different accident types evolve over the years. The **Accident Types by Severity** visualization presents a stacked bar chart depicting the distribution of accident types by severity. The **Severity of Accidents on Each Day of the Week** visualizes the severity of accidents through stacked bars for each day. The **Accident Types Heatmap** provides a heatmap illustrating correlations between accident types and days of the week, rounding out our comprehensive analysis.

### Instructions for Use
